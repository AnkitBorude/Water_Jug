<h1> Water Jug Problem  in AI</h1>

<p>In this Project , I Solved the famous <b>Water Jug</b> Problem in the <b> Artificial Intellegience </b> with <b> bruteforce stratergy </b>
using <b>BFS</b> or <b>DFS</b> Algorithm (i.e. Uninformed search stratergy) to search through possible state space for <b> Desired Goal State</b>.
  The<i>Main.java</i> File is the starting point of the program.
  
  <ul>
    <li>We need to choose the required engine(i.e Algorithm) by assigning Object of BFS or DFS to 
      IEngine Interface.
      <b>Note.:-</b> We hvae to provide the maximum depth for DFS algorithm, where DFS algorithm would go to the given depth at one side and then 
      it would start backtracking.
     </li>
    <li>Next we need to create Object of Jugs by providing maximum capacity of Jugs(jug1,jug2).ie.Jugs(4,3)</li>
    <li>Next we need to define initial State of the Jugs and Goal State of Jugs through Jugs.State class.</li>
    <li> In the end we need to create Object of ProductionSystem and pass the jugs object,initial state, final state, and engine for searching(i.e. Object      of Searching Algorithm) and that its.</li>
    </ul>
